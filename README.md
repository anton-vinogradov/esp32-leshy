# ESP32-Leshy 1.x

Read this in: **English** · [Русский](README.ru.md)

ESP32-Leshy 1.x is a from-scratch redesign of the firmware for the
[ESP32-DIV](https://github.com/CiferTech/ESP32-DIV) wireless multitool.

## Development status and roadmap

> **Now: S6 — Product differentiation: Targets, comparison, companion**
>
> Stage gates complete: 5 of 9.

This front-page snapshot is generated from the authoritative 1.x documentation; CI rejects it if it drifts.

- **Current phase:** `S6.5 — local USB/Web companion over shared Actions and schemas`.
- **Verified checkpoint:** exact `0.165.0-targets-fixture-reopen` at firmware source `19a322c428d6efa52fe18f62041141e0cf6669d8` and verification source `b3a19e2a99b764d33b8de9eac802102a35fdb084` is physically accepted in `E-AUTO-116`/`E-HIL-176`/`E-UX-052`. An isolated disposable LittleFS fixture presents the ownership preview and explicit confirmation, atomically merges two one-identity/one-evidence Targets 2→1 at generation 0→1, cold-reopens the same two-identity/two-evidence graph and immutable history, then splits 1→2 at generation 1→2 and cold-reopens both original IDs and exact graph fingerprints. Each mutation uses three writes plus three file and directory syncs; both reset records retain 8,040 B minimum worker stack. Exact OTA1 and partition-table bytes are restored, the product SD remains untouched, final exact-CID Session generation 161 reopens read-only with 59 observations, and the device finishes Home/none/lease 0 with zero RF attempts. The exact flash is reused and only `/dev/cu.usbmodem2101` is opened; Cardputer ports and discovery calls remain zero. This closes S6.4; the deferred S5 RF-positive gate remains open.
- **Next gate:** define and host-verify the first S6.5 companion contract: a local, explicitly scoped connection lists and opens the same Session/Target/Compare records through versioned schemas and the existing typed Action boundary, with no direct driver/storage access and no broader permission than the device session. The physical S5 gate remains postponed, not waived, until the replacement DIV arrives and passes its read-only profile.

### Current stage phases

| Phase | Outcome / exit gate | Status |
|---|---|---|
| S6.1 | Target foundation: stable Target IDs, exact radio identities, editable name/tags/notes/favorite and immutable source-evidence references, all bounded and host-verified | ✅ complete |
| S6.2 | Explainable correlation proposes links with features/confidence; accept/reject and reversible merge/split never destroy source evidence | ✅ complete |
| S6.3 | Baseline/diff compares two Sessions and classifies new, disappeared and changed Targets with every conclusion opening its evidence | ✅ complete |
| S6.4 | On-device Targets and Compare workflows expose the useful result first, stable navigation and full-area detail views | ✅ complete |
| S6.5 | Local USB/Web companion uses the same Actions and versioned schemas with scoped connectivity and secrets | 🟡 in progress |
| S6.6 | Integrated DEMO-S6: record and compare two surveys, inspect each conclusion on-device or locally, export offline, then return to and close the deferred S5 physical predecessor gate before S6 acceptance | ⬜ later |

<!-- LESHY-ROADMAP:END -->

Released 0.x remains a frozen proof-of-concept line; no user-facing 1.x binary has
been released yet.

## Version lines

- **0.x — archived PoC:** existing menu firmware, feature list, hardware notes, and
  development guide are preserved in the [0.x archive](docs/archive/v0.x/README.md).
  The [web installer](https://anton-vinogradov.github.io/esp32-leshy/) currently flashes
  this line.
- **1.x — active redesign:** product discovery, architecture, and the new
  capability/resource-aware application runtime live under [docs/v1](docs/v1/README.md).

## What 1.x is building

Leshy is becoming a field instrument organized around a complete workflow:

> discover → identify → locate → capture → compare → reproduce safely in your own lab
> → preserve and export the evidence.

The product is organized around Survey, Targets, Capture, Lab, Library, and Device
rather than a growing list of unrelated radio screens. Wi-Fi, BLE, NRF24, CC1101,
IR, NFC, GPS, and storage become capabilities shared by those workflows.

## Development

Documentation defines the 1.x scope and gates. Current code, prototype, and
verification state lives only in [STATUS](docs/v1/STATUS.md). The front-page roadmap
is generated from that status and the delivery plan, keeping this README from becoming
a competing source of truth.

```

## Responsible use

Use Leshy only with equipment you own or are explicitly authorized in writing to test.
Passive observation is the default. Transmit and replay workflows belong to an explicit
Lab context with visible state, bounded duration, and immediate stop. Full terms:
